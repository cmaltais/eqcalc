The English Qaballah Calculator
===============================

INTRO
-----

The EQC is a tool for magickians that converts certain words to
numerical values and numerical values to certain words and phrases.

If that sounds rather mysterious, then the history and usage of the EQC
is described in more detail at: http://tinyurl.com/bvoldnk

It was originally hosted on the multi-award-winning occult website, The
Baptist's Head.

SETUP
-----

These instructions assume you know how to set up PHP websites and MySQL
databases, and that you already have a working webroot ready to receive
these files.

1. Copy the files in this project to your webroot folder.

2. Create a MySQL database and a user with access to that database.

3. Run the SQL file 'qaballah.sql' against your database.

4. Create in your EQC webroot a file named 'eqcalc-settings.php'.

5. This file should contain the following, with the parts in square
   brackets replaced with appropriate values:
   
   <?php
	   $host = "localhost";
	   $database = "[database name]";
	   $user = "[username]";
	   $password = "[password]";
   ?>

6. Invoke your EQC webroot to consult the English Qaballah Calculator.

It's basic and the code is ugly, but that's why we've released it.

Be sure to let us know if you host a version of this code anywhere on
the web, and we'll link back to it from http://thebaptistshead.co.uk.
